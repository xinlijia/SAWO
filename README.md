### Navigation

2. You can see a stage selection with rating on each stage. Choose any one you like.
3. Then you come into a play interface and ready to play.

### How to Win
1. You act as a man who is trapped in a maze. What you can do is to plan what your character can do.
You may see two bars on the top left of the screen. The left one will contain some arrow-like icons. You can drag them into the line closed to the bottom of the screen. This line is a timeline of your character. Once you push the control button under the line, a pointer will start to move. When the pointer moves on an icon, your character will do the same move as the icon says. That's the way you control your character get out of the maze.

2. The right bar on the top left is a tool box with tools you can put into the maze to help your character get out. For example, you may put a U-turn tool on the path you character plans to go. Your character will immediately turn back when it reaches the tool. This is another way you can control your character.

3. For each maze there will be an exit. Once your character reaches the exit. Your win this stage.

4. Remember you can use the control button to fast fast forward or pause. You can also reuse a move after the pointer passes it.

5. Enjoy your puzzle solving!

## Contribution
Collaborative contribution is welcome. You can either PM me your idea and feedback or folk the repo and send me a pull request with interesting improvement. You can also start with one in the following TODO list.

Also you can design the maze yourself. For now you can use a text file to design a stage and put it under `maze/`. We will build a map editor in the future.

## TODO

1. More moves and tools, more stages
2. Multi-character stage
3. Life system
4. Better art design
